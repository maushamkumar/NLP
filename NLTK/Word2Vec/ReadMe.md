We have two sub-directories in the main directory: `Output` and `pyimagesearch`. 

The `output` directory contains all the results and visualizations of our project. The `pyimagesearch`  directory contains several scripts

- `config.py`:  Contains the complete configuration pipeline. 
- `create_vocabulary.py`:  Helps create the vocabulary for our project. 
- `__init__.py`: Makes the `pyimagesearch` directory work as a python package. 

In the parent directory, we have:

- `train_CBOW.py`: Training script for CBOW architecture.
- `train_SkipGram.py`: Training script for Skip-Gram architecture.
- `data.txt`: Contains the training data for our project.

Thanks for reading! 
I want to add this to the github repository.
